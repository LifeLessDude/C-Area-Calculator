Guys this is a README file for people who want to know how this works

Starting , We add all necessary libraries.
We then declare a function and print "Enter Radius Of Circle:" onto the console.
Then We create a variable to store that value called 'radius'.
Then We read the value from the console and stuff it in 'radius' using the 'cin' function.
Then we create a variable to hold the value of pi called 'pi'.
And then we calculate the necessary calculations in the variable called 'area'.

Then Finally we print the 'area' variable onto the console.

Easy Enough?
